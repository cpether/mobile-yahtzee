# Ensure only one app instance is running before starting dev server

## Description
Before running the development server with `npm run dev`, always kill all previously running instances of the app (including any `vite`, `node`, or `npm run dev` processes related to the project). This guarantees that only one instance of the app is running at any time, preventing port conflicts and resource waste.

## Actions
- Before executing `npm run dev`, run:
  - `pkill -f "vite"`
  - `pkill -f "npm run dev"`
  - Optionally, `pkill -f "node.*vite"` for extra safety
- Only after confirming all previous instances are killed, proceed to start the new dev server.

## Rationale
- Prevents multiple dev servers from running simultaneously
- Avoids port conflicts and confusion
- Ensures a clean development environment

## Examples

### Bad
```
$ npm run dev
# (multiple Vite servers running, port conflicts)
```

### Good
```
$ pkill -f "vite"
$ pkill -f "npm run dev"
$ npm run dev
# (only one Vite server running)
```

## Enforcement
- Always perform the kill commands before starting the dev server.
- If you are automating or scripting, include these steps in your workflow.
