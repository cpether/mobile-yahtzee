# Mobile Yahtzee Game - Specifications

This document serves as the master specification overview for the mobile web-based Yahtzee game. Each domain topic has been broken down into separate specification files for clarity and maintainability.

## Project Overview

A mobile-first web application implementing the classic dice game Yahtzee, supporting both local pass-and-play and online multiplayer modes. Players can create games with unique codes, invite friends to join from their own devices, and play together in real-time. The game features animated dice rolling, comprehensive scorekeeping, and follows official Yahtzee rules.
